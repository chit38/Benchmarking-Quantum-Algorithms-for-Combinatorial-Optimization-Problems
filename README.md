# Benchmarking Quantum Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization Problems

Several quantum optimization algorithms such as QAOA and VQE have been proposed for solving combinatorial optimizations  problems. Since these can be run with smaller depths, these are also potential candidates for Quantum advantage in NISQ era. Here, we survey these algorithms and benchmark their performance on multiple NP-Hard combinatorial optimization problems, using IBM Qiskit. We also compare their timings on IBMQ backend simulator.
